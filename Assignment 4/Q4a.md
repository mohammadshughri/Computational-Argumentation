a) Evaluating the statements:

1. "The training set should contain all news articles whose stance is pro, while the test set should contain all news articles that are con."

    **Incorrect.** This setup would lead to biased results. The model should be trained and tested on a mix of pro and con articles to ensure it can generalize to both stances.

2. "The training set should contain all news articles that are labeled as very effective or moderately effective, while the test set should contain news articles that are labeled as somehow effective or not effective."

    **Incorrect.** This would create a biased model that hasn't learned from the full range of effectiveness levels. The training and test sets should both contain a mix of all effectiveness levels.

3. "To increase robustness, it is best when the training and test sets contain news articles with balanced distribution over all authors."

    **Correct.** A balanced distribution of authors in both sets helps ensure the model learns general patterns rather than author-specific quirks, and can generalize to different writing styles.
