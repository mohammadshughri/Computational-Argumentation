1) Slippery Slope: The teacher assumes that allowing one instance of a pupil going to the toilet will create a chain reaction that will lead to many more students also wanting to do it (without explaining why that would happen)

2) Ad hominem: It is implied that the arguments of the candidate are not worth listening to because he's shown to be stupid in other areas of life.

3) Appeal to emotion: Using the word "cruel" for a punishment for a crime is controversial, thus this emotionally charged word qualifies as "unessential loading of the argument with emotional language."

4) False cause: No reason has been provided of why this correlation is due to causation.
