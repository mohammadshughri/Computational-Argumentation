A:
    Issue: "Green energy is the way for a healthy and sustainable life"
         t(i) =  "Green energy"

    Claim: "Fossile fuels are easy to store."
         t(c) = "Fossile fuels"

B:

    P(t(c)) = 1 : "easy to store" has positive sense

    P(t(i)) = 1 : "healthy" and "sustainable life" has positive sense
    
    c(t(c) , t(i)) = -1 : both are talking about energy and their pros, on the other hand based on Wikipedia headers
                         they have controvesial sentiment.
    𝑠=𝑝(𝑡𝑐)⋅𝑐(𝑡𝑐,𝑡𝑖)⋅𝑝(𝑡𝑖) = 1 . -1 .1 = -1  : it means that two arguments are related but has opposite stance.
