Nodes $v_i$ and $v_{i+3}$ have equal edge and vertex paths.

esyscmd(`./genpaths')
Since the graph only has one branch from the root node, it is easy to see and for any other two vertices, their edge- and vertex-paths will
be different, since their lengths must differ.

For the denominator: $ |T_a| = |T_b| = 3 $

Expanding the sum, discarding all products that evaluate to zero and combining all divisions (possible due to d=1) yields:

$$ \left(\frac{1+1+1}{(3*3)^2}\right)^1 = \frac{1}{27} $$
