a) The accuracy is $\frac{6}{10}$

b) Since this classifier adds no accuracy to the baseline, it is very bad. It reduces the bias of a constant classifier in exchange for some variance.

c) I would choose my classifier with the higher accuracy on the test set, as validation set accuracy might be biased since it would be allowed to tune hyperparameters for it.
