Graph1:

set of accepted:{A1,A3} there isn't any conflict and A1 defends A3 by attacking to A4
set of not accepted: {A2,A4} both attacked by accepted arguments (A1 attack A2)(A3 attack A2)(A1 attack A4)

Graph2:

set of not accepted:{A2, A4} both attacked by an accepted

Graph3:
set of accepted:{A1,A3,A5} there is no conflict, and A1 defend itself, A3 defend A1 and A5 by attack A2 and A4, A5 defend itself
set of not accepted:{A2,A4} all attack by accepted arguments

Graph4:
set of accepted:{A1,A3,A5} A1 defend itself of all attacks, and defend A3 by attack to A2, and A3 defend A5 by attack to A4
set of not accepted: {A2,A4,A6} all of them attacked by an accepted argument
