Bi-directional fits extractive approach, because it is an encoder based on previos and following inputs
which can find out which argument is a key point, and can classify them

Left-to-right decode fits abstractive approach, because it works for generating and in abstractive approach,
it generates new argument in the form of paraphrasing or new words.
