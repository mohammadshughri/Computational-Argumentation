Random will be bad for machine translation, diversity doesn't matter and a bad dice roll completely destroy the meaning of the translation.

Due to low diversity requirement, greedy can be acceptable for translation.

Top-K will be better suited for argument generation, as creativity and diversity are more important than maximal accuracy.

Beam-Search will produce the highest quality and should be used unless keeping energy costs down is more important.
I can imagine that it will not produce as big of a gain for machine translation as the process is already somewhat guided by the input data.
