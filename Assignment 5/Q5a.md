Greedy decoding is the simplest decoding strategy and thus has the lowest development cost. But it will produce the same text on the same inputs, which can be desireable,
but in most contexts will feel repetitive. The failure mode in the example (stuck in a loop) is a combination of no search and a low fidelity model.

Random sampling can be used instead of the greedy strategy to avoid repetitiveness and loops. It has roughly the same development and computation cost (the increase is negligible)
while trading off an increase in creativity and diversity for lowered adequacy as on average, worse next tokens will be chosen according to the model.

Top-K Sampling improves on random sampling by making is impossible for the tail end of bad next tokens to be chosen, leading to a good balance of diversity and adequacy.
It is slightly more involved to develop, especially to experiment and find a good k.

Search will lead to much higher adequacy, as it allows our sampling plan ahead and find good chains that aren't possible when purely hill-climbing.
The biggest tradeoff is the higher computational cost, as inference is the costly operation (especially compared to random sampling).
Beam search is used to bound memory and computation requirement and prevent them from becoming exponential (compared to for exaple breadth first search) at the cost of
output quality.
Development cost is also higher, but the complexity is not very big, the cost won't be high.
