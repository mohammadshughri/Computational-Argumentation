To train an autoencoder that can encode and decode claims, labeled training data is not needed. Autoencoders are unsupervised learning models, meaning they don't require labeled data for training. The model learns to reconstruct its input, using the input itself as both the training data and the target output. The network aims to minimize the reconstruction error between the input and the output.
