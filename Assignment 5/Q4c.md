For abstractive summarization, BERTScore is the most appropriate metric because it evaluates the semantic similarity between the generated summary and the reference text, rather than just surface-level n-gram overlap. This makes it better suited to capture the nuances and meanings intended in abstractive summarization, where the goal is to distill the essential information into a new form that may not have direct n-gram correspondences with the original text.
