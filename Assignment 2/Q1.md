A) in BIO algorithm, O labels show predicted as non-argumentative and I lables show predicted as argumentative.
negative and positive labels define as below:

TP = 13

FP = 3

FN = 4

TN = 1

precision = $\frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP+FP}}$ = $\frac{13}{16}$ = 0.8125

recall = $\frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP+FN}}$ = $\frac{13}{17}$ = 0.7647


B) F1-score try to find a balance between recall and precision value, So how much these two values are closer, 
the value for F1-score will be higher. 
So algortihm A2 with less different in values of recall and precisions has higher F1-score
