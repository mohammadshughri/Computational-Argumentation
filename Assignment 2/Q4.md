a) We choose argument model 1: `premise->solution` for this task.
It's not important for finding a warrant to know exactly what the quality of the data is.
It's much more important to know *what* the data says to find out how it relates to the conclusion.\
Also, argument model 2 would have trouble classifying some types of premise, i.e. expert testimony. Since we don't know the exact kind of input text, it's will be hard to define a very expressive model like model 2 tries to establish.
