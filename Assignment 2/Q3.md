# WEAT Score Calculation for Word Embedding Models

To determine which word embedding model ($E$ or $E'$) is more biased, we need to calculate the WEAT score for each model.

1. Compute the cosine similarity for each target word with each attribute word.
2. Calculate the differential association \( s(w, A, B) \) for each target word.
3. Compute the WEAT score \( S(X, Y, A, B) \).

### Step 1: Cosine Similarity

The cosine similarity between two vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \) is given by:

$$
\cos(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{u}\| \|\mathbf{v}\|}
$$

Where \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} \) is the dot product and \( \|\mathbf{u}\| \) is the norm (magnitude) of the vector.

### Step 2: Differential Association \( s(w, A, B) \)

$$
s(w, A, B) = \text{mean}_{a \in A} \cos(w, a) - \text{mean}_{b \in B} \cos(w, b)
$$

### Step 3: WEAT Score \( S(X, Y, A, B) \)

$$
S(X, Y, A, B) = \sum_{x \in X}s(x, A, B) - \sum_{y \in Y} s(y, A, B)
$$

## Word Embedding Model \( E \)

### Cosine Similarities

For \( E \):

- \( x = (0.5, 0.5) \)
- \( y = (0.1, 0.8) \)
- \( a_1 = (0.2, 0.8) \)
- \( a_2 = (0.3, 0.7) \)
- \( b_1 = (0.7, 0.7) \)
- \( b_2 = (0.5, 0.6) \)

#### Cosine Similarities Calculations

- \( \cos(x, a_1) \approx 0.86 \)
- \( \cos(x, a_2) \approx 0.93 \)
- \( \cos(x, b_1) \approx 0.99 \)
- \( \cos(x, b_2) \approx 0.98 \)

- \( \cos(y, a_1) \approx 0.99 \)
- \( \cos(y, a_2) \approx 0.96 \)
- \( \cos(y, b_1) \approx 0.78 \)
- \( \cos(y, b_2) \approx 0.84 \)

### Differential Associations

- \( s(x, A, B) = \frac{0.86 + 0.93}{2} - \frac{0.99 + 0.98}{2} = 0.895 - 0.985 = -0.09 \)
- \( s(y, A, B) = \frac{0.99 + 0.96}{2} - \frac{0.78 + 0.84}{2} = 0.975 - 0.81 = 0.17 \)

### WEAT Score for \( E \)

$$
S(X, Y, A, B) = s(x, A, B) - s(y, A, B) = -0.09 - 0.17 = -0.26
$$

## Word Embedding Model \( E' \)

### Cosine Similarities

For \( E' \):

- \( x = (0.5, 0.5) \)
- \( y = (0.47, 0.53) \)
- \( a_1 = (0.2, 0.4) \)
- \( a_2 = (0.3, 0.6) \)
- \( b_1 = (0.4, 0.2) \)
- \( b_2 = (0.6, 0.3) \)

#### Cosine Similarities Calculations

- \( \cos(x, a_1) \approx 0.94 \)
- \( \cos(x, a_2) \approx 0.94 \)
- \( \cos(x, b_1) \approx 0.94 \)
- \( \cos(x, b_2) \approx 0.94 \)

- \( \cos(y, a_1) \approx 0.96 \)
- \( \cos(y, a_2) \approx 0.96 \)
- \( \cos(y, b_1) \approx 0.92 \)
- \( \cos(y, b_2) \approx 0.93 \)

### Differential Associations

- \( s(x, A, B) = \frac{0.94 + 0.94}{2} - \frac{0.94 + 0.94}{2} = 0.94 - 0.94 = 0 \)
- \( s(y, A, B) = \frac{0.96 + 0.96}{2} - \frac{0.92 + 0.93}{2} = 0.96 - 0.925 = 0.035 \)

### WEAT Score for \( E' \)

$$
S(X, Y, A, B) = s(x, A, B) - s(y, A, B) = 0 - 0.035 = -0.035
$$

## Conclusion

- The WEAT score for model \( E \) is \(-0.26\).
- The WEAT score for model \( E' \) is \(-0.035\).

These scores indicate the differential association of the target words (Man and Woman) with the attribute words (related to jobs like Cleaner, Secretary, Leader, and Professor). A more negative score suggests a stronger association of the target word with negative or potentially biased attribute words.

In this case, model \( E \) has a more negative score than model \( E' \), indicating that model \( E \) exhibits more bias according to the WEAT score. Model \( E' \), with a score closer to zero, suggests less bias in its associations.
